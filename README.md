## Pether,  a Whatsapp bot doing transactions on Ethereum
#### Splitting bills, transferring tokens, creating a new wallet, all from Whatsapp by asking or adding Pether to your group
### Meet Pether
Pether is a smart, but still rather narrow AI WhatsApp bot. You can add him as your friend, and start asking him things like “Hey Pether, send 2 eth to Sponnet please”. He will talk balk (in a nice way) and do your transactions. 
In a couple of months we should for example be able to teach children the value of saving money by having them interact with a smart and entertaining character that performs the actual financial service as well.
With Pether (this is the higher perspective) I want to start exploring the line between servicing and entertainment. Why should there even be a line? I for one think it would be fun to get my services done in a way that’s also entertaining. And in the other direction, in my entertainment I want to be able to have services. Right on. So Pether will be the first experiment in getting an animated character some brains and the power to do financial services. 

### The business model
Pether does not have a house and does not need food. Living on a blockchain and interacting somewhere in the cloud, he needs nothing. 
(sigh — wouldn't we all want that?) 
However, he still needs a lot of education and help from smart developers. So Pether will charge a fixed flat fee on every transaction he facilitates. How much this fee is depends on the number of clients, to Pether it does not matter if he has to handle 10 or 100.000 clients. It’s the same trouble. So the more clients he has, the cheaper it will become for all — omg thats like cryptoSocialism
The development model
As Pether hopefully makes some money, he needs a way to spend it. That’s where Trelleth comes in. Pether will send a small fee to his spiritual father @kingflurkel (who wants to invest in more shit like this) and to a Trelleth enabled Trello board. On it, his developmental coaches can propose features and enhancements. These developmental coaches are project token holders that can vote on which task needs to be done (and in what order). Project tokens can be earned by executing tasks on the Trelleth enabled board.
### The initial development funding
@kingflurkel  will pay for getting Pether out of the incubator. Nobody wants to spend time in an incubator, right?
Right?
